# Restaurant Management Command Line App using CORBA

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Restaurant Management Command Line App using CORBA! This project, developed by Peeyush Gupta, showcases a robust and efficient restaurant management application that utilizes the power of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). Designed to serve both customers and managers, the app streamlines the ordering process, enhances user experience, and provides valuable insights into system performance.
